# Introduction

::: {layout-ncol=2}

We created this survey about the state of Consumer Price Index (CPI) Production Systems on behalf of the [Task Team on Scanner Data](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/task-teams/scanner/index.cshtml) under the [UN Committee of Experts on Big Data and Data Science for Official Statistics](https://unstats.un.org/bigdata/).

While this report is specific to the state of CPI Production Systems at National Statistics Organizations (NSOs) around the world, we attempt to explain our results in a general way and highlight opportunities where our survey approach could be applied in related settings.

## Overview of CPI Production Systems

CPI Production Systems are complex [sociotechnical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system) that require significant expertise across multiple skill domains such as Economics, Statistics, and Computer Science in order to develop and maintain them. The recent adoption of alternative data sources[^1] has significantly increased the complexity of these systems, and has increased the importance of skills in newly emerging disciplines such as [Data Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science), [Data Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_engineering), and [Analytics Engineering](https://www.getdbt.com/what-is-analytics-engineering).

[^1]: In the context of CPI systems, alternative data sources refer to data such as retailer scanner and web-scraped data that can be used to calculate the component price changes that are used in CPI calculations.

## What This Survey Is About

We are trying to characterize how CPI Systems and the teams that own them are organized in order to improve business outcomes for these teams.

Our survey asks a series of questions about how software systems and teams are organized with respect to a fairly generic data processing workflow. We then ask several questions related to the various tools and technologies being used by the various teams maintaining CPI Systems. We conclude by asking a series of questions related to business outcomes of interest.

## Related Work

We borrow and adapt several ideas presented in @skelton2019team such as the concepts of [Stream-aligned teams and the Flow of change](https://teamtopologies.com/key-concepts) in our survey. These concepts (discussed in greater detail in the following sections) can be applied to understand how teams are organized around the various steps in a complex data processing workflow.

We also borrow a number of ideas from @forsgren2018accelerate. Particularly, multiple of the DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics presented are highly relevant in measuring the business outcomes of teams that maintain CPI systems.[^2]

[^2]: We use slightly different terminology to refer to these concepts throughout the survey in order to use language that our target audience is most likely familiar with.

We believe that multiple ideas presented in @dehghani2022data are highly applicable to the CPI Systems under study. Specifically, we believe that the concept of [Data-as-a-Product](https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-ca/insights/articles/leveraging-data-as-a-product-a-strategic-imperative-for-business-leaders) (and teams organized around these Data Products) provides a useful framework for thinking about how these systems and teams interact with one another. We also contrast domain-oriented decentralized teams with centralized teams.

Although we do not make specific references to it in our survey, we believe the Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) work by @RAPsite does a good job at explaining how teams can introduce relevant tools and practices to workloads oriented around data processing.

## How This Report Is Organized

@sec-concepts covers the key concepts used in the survey. @sec-sys-team analyzes our findings with respect to system and team organization.

## Note on Confidentiality and Privacy

As part of the administration of this survey, we ensured respondents that their data will be treated confidentiality. Therefore, no individual response data are made available in this report; all results presented are aggregated over all responses.
